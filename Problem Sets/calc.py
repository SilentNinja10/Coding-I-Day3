                    # Fractional Calculator

"""
Create a calculator that can take in fractions as input like below:

    $ python calc.py
    First number: 5/3
    Operation: x
    Second number: 10/7
    50/21


Bonus Challenges:


Try implementing as much functionality as youâ€™re able to! 
First try allowing your calculator to handle both fractions and non-fractions, such as:
    $ python calc.py
    First number: 5/3
    Operation: x
    Second number: 10
    50/3

    $ python calc.py
    Expression: 1/3 ^ 3
    1/9

    $ python calc.py
    Expression: 1/3 ^ 3 * 13/2 + 7/4
    89/36
